# Description

Bike Kollective is a mobile application which allows the
users to share their used bikes with everyone else or choose an available used bike
from their nearby-location for free. In order to use this app, the users first need to
download it from GitHub, create an account, and sign
an accident waiver.

The user can share his or her bike by entering an area of where the bike locks up,
uploading its picture, signing a release of interest, and entering his or her combination
into the app.

The user can choose an available used bike by entering his or her location in the search
location box, the app will display all available nearby-used bikes via a map. The user
will receive the combination to the lock after checking out his or her selected bike. The
bike is then ready to ride, when done, the user can park, lock it, and update the app to
“done”.

Each user can share his or her riding experiences by rating the ride and commenting on
anything wrong with the bike. The user is restricted to park the bike within 24 hours of
using it, otherwise, his/her account will be locked and they will not be able to borrow the
bike again.
