Theft is a serious issue that we do not take lightly. If your bike is stolen, please report it missing/stolen on the app and contact local authorities to file a report. Please report any other bikes that are missing as well so we may remove the user who checked it out from the app.  

All bikes added to our app are considered 'donated', as they will be used by the public for free. Click I agree if you have reviewed the Terms of Service and are okay with donating your bike for public use.
